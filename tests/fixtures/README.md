# Fixture Files

This directory contains test fixture files used by the Playwright test suite.

## Files:

- `emblem.png` - Primary test image file (should be copied from original fixtures)
- `emblem2.png` - Secondary test image file (should be copied from original fixtures) 
- `sample.txt` - Text file for testing invalid uploads

## Usage:

These files are referenced in tests using relative paths like `./fixtures/emblem.png`.

## Note:

The actual image files (emblem.png and emblem2.png) need to be copied from your original test fixtures directory, as they contain binary data that cannot be recreated in this reorganization.
