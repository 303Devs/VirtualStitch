## 🏗 New Architecture

### Logical Organization
```
tests/
├── core/           # Component functionality
├── integration/    # User workflows  
├── quality/        # Performance, accessibility, security
├── api/           # Backend integration
├── deployment/    # Production validation
├── utils/         # Shared utilities
└── fixtures/      # Test data
```

### Smart Test Categories

**🚀 Core Tests** - Fast, focused component testing  
**🔄 Integration Tests** - Complete user journey validation  
**🛡 Quality Tests** - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, a11y)  
**🌐 API Tests** - Backend communication and error handling  
**📦 Deployment Tests** - Production readiness and smoke testing  

## 🎨 Developer Experience Improvements

### Before: Manual, Repetitive Setup
```typescript
test('should change color', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Customize It' }).click();
  await page.waitForTimeout(1500); // Fixed wait
  await page.getByTestId('editor-tab-colorPicker').click();
  await page.getByTitle('#80C670').click();
  // Manual verification...
});
```

### After: Streamlined, Reusable Utilities
```typescript
test('should change color', async ({ page }) => {
  await utils.nav.goToCustomizer();
  await utils.color.openColorPicker();
  await utils.color.selectColor('#80C670');
  await utils.color.verifyColorApplied('#80C670');
});
```
